# Track it or Lose it 
Track it or lose it is your diet diary. This app helps you maintain a healthy diet by monitoring the amount of calories/macronutrients you consume daily. Simply enter your meal content and we'll tell you many calories, carbs, proteins and fats you have consumed. We can also give you a personal estimate of the daily recommended calories/macronutrients based on a few factors such as your age, weight, and gender and suggest a recommended diet for those who are looking to lose or gain a few pounds.
